# Coronary-Disease--Prediction

This is a python project where ML models are trained and tested on a patient dataset to predict the likelihood of someone having coronary disease. This is done by training models on patient health data. The data sources as well as the data dictionary have been provided in the python notebook. The python libraries used are: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn. The notebook also goes over model tuning using randomized search and grid search.
